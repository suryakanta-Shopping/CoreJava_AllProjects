In Java 'Map' collection interface is implemented by several classes
	
	
	1)HashTable
	
	2)ConcurrentHashMap
	
	3)TreeMap
	
	4)HashMap

	5)LinkedHashMap
	
	6)WeakHashMap

	7)EnumHashMap

	8)IdentityHashMap
	 

  1)HashTable
--------------

- It is Legacy class

- It is synchronized and thread-safe

- Working in Multi-threaded Environment 

- It might slower in multi-threaded Environment compared to 'ConcurrentHashMap'


2) ConcurrentHashMap
--------------------

- It is introduced in java 5 

- It is designed for concurrent use and provides better scalability than 'Hashtable' for concurrent operations

- It doesn't lock the entire map during updates

3) TreeMap
-----------

- using red-black tree

- It provides guaranted log(n) time cost for the 'containsKey','get','put' and 'remove' operations

- It maintains keys in a sorted order

4) HashMap
